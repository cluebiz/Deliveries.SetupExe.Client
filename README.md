Our packages are produced in XML format and are therefore not dependent on a scripting language such as PowerShell.

This gives you the following advantages:
<ul>
<li>Open source XML file, which can be easily read</li>
<li>Security through transparent package format, no malicious code can be hidden in the scripts</li>
<li>Independent of your distribution solution, deploy the packages on VDI, Intune or FAT</li>
<li>Architecture independent, our package format works on x86, x64 and arm64 processors, but also on macOS</li>
<li>Easy editing of the XML file in the online editor or locally in your text editor</li>
<li>Automatic adaptation of your guidelines, due to the open XML format automated changes can be made</li>
<li>Easy to learn the format, our online help has many practical examples</li>
</ul>
