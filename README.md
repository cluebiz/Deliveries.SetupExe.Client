# Deliveries.SetupExe.Client

Our packages are produced in XML format and are therefore not dependent on a scripting language such as PowerShell.

This gives you the following advantages:

* Open source XML file, which can be easily read
* Security through transparent package format, no malicious code can be hidden in the scripts
* Independent of your distribution solution, deploy the packages on VDI, Intune or FAT
* Architecture independent, our package format works on x86, x64 and arm64 processors, but also on macOS
* Easy editing of the XML file in the online editor or locally in your text editor
* Automatic adaptation of your guidelines, due to the open XML format automated changes can be made
* Easy to learn the format, our online help has many practical examples
